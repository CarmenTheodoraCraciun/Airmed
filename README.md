## The Airmed story

Airmed is, in Irish mythology, a goddess of healing. In the case of an individual with a mental disorder, the healing process is essential to restore mental balance.

Through a web application, easy to use by those looking for help, but also comfortable for the "descendants" of the goddess, those specialized in helping in the fight against mental disorders, Airmed is a software that creates and supports the connection between these people.
